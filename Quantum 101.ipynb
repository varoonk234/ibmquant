We have used sets of rules, known as algorithms, to solve the mathematical equations that describe problems in physics for many decades. When quantum mechanics was discovered in the 1900s, scientists soon became intrigued by the possibility of using it to process information. And so, quantum computing was born!  \n",

This was a thought experiment thought up by Schrodinger in which he imagined putting a cat in a box with a vile of poison that could release itself at any time. Without looking inside the box, there is no way to tell whether the cat was dead or alive, and therefore he postured that the cat was in a superposition of both dead and alive states. Only by looking inside (i.e. making a measurement on the system), would determine the outcome.\n",

In quantum computing, one operation acts on all $2^n$ possible states, whereas a classical computer would require an exponential number of operations on all of these states! Amazing!

    "Google recently claimed to have reached the incredible feat of \"quantum supremacy\" (basically performing a task that would be impossible to perform on a classical computer) on its 53-qubit processor, Sycamore. The problem that it solved involves a series of calculations be performed and each qubit outputs either a 0 or a 1. The probability of each possible outcome occurring is then determined. Sycamore discovered the solution in a mere few minutes, as opposed to the practically eternal 10,000 years on the a powerful supercomputer! Although this has been disputed by IBM, who argue that leveraging plentiful disk storage could lead to a solution within 2.5 days as opposed to 10,000 years, it shows that the exciting capabilities of quantum computers are not so far out of reach.

Although impressive in magnitude, D-Wave is not quite a \"quantum computer\" but actually an \"adiabatic quantum computer\". In simple terms, it relies on the idea of embedding the computational problem of interest into a physical system, such that the systems lowest energy configuration (known as it's ground state) stores the solution. However such systems are more useful for optimization problems and hence are not as versatile as conventional \"Universal Gate\" quantum computers."
